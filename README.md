# School_District_Analysis

## Project Summary 
This project consits in performing analysis on a dataset that contains information about test scores from each school in a district. The dataset contains information of 4000 students' math and reading scores, from different schools in the district, from grade 9 till 12 and schools' budget for the year. Schools include both charter and public establishments. 


## Project Results

* Average school budget is nearly 90K dollars per year
* Average math score is below par, it is on average lower (64) than the reading score (72)
* Charter schools have a lower budget, on average, than public schools
* Math scores vary widely amongst charter and public schools.
* Math scores fall more drastically across grades in charter schools, while they remain nearly constant across grades in public schools.
* However, math scores are generally better in charter schools.
